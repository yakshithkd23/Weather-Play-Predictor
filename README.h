What is Decision tree ?

Decison tree is the type of machine learning . it can used for the classification and regression .it will split the data into the different branches based on the feature condition and final calss represent the predicted class or value.

how it works?

The tree is built using a recursive partitioning approach, selecting the best attribute at each step based on Entropy and Information Gain.

📝 note: Recursive partioning approach-is popular predictive modeling techniques.it creates a tree like structure based on data splits. it is simple to interpret using “if-then” rules.Handles classification and regression tasks.Efficient in pattern recognition for medical and data science applications.

Mathematical Calculation for Decision Tree Construction (ID3 Algorithm

formulas:
Entropy (E): Measures data impurity.
E(s)= -(p1*log2(p1)+p2*log2(p2))  .....equ(1)

p1 and p2 are positive and negative samples

information gain:

IG= E(s)-E(after)   ......equ(2)

   whereae , E(s)- total value entropy
             E(after)-weigted avaerage entropy
        
  E(after)= ∑ (|Sv|/|s| *E(Sv))   ......equ(3)
    𝑆
|S|= Total number of instance
|Sv|=number of instance in Sv (example under total, 5 number of rainy is there so it is |Sv| is 5)
sv = subset data value of s(example : weather it may be sunny or rainy entropy value )



Example: Play Tennis Decision Tree



| Day  | Outlook  | Temperature | Humidity | Windy  | Play |
|------|---------|------------|----------|--------|------|
| D1   | Rainy   | Hot        | High     | False  | No   |
| D2   | Rainy   | Hot        | High     | True   | No   |
| D3   | Overcast| Hot        | High     | False  | Yes  |
| D4   | Sunny   | Mild       | High     | False  | Yes  |
| D5   | Sunny   | Cool       | Normal   | False  | Yes  |
| D6   | Sunny   | Cool       | Normal   | True   | No   |
| D7   | Overcast| Cool       | Normal   | True   | Yes  |
| D8   | Rainy   | Mild       | High     | False  | No   |
| D9   | Rainy   | Cool       | Normal   | False  | Yes  |
| D10  | Sunny   | Mild       | Normal   | False  | Yes  |
| D11  | Rainy   | Mild       | Normal   | True   | Yes  |
| D12  | Overcast| Mild       | High     | True   | Yes  |
| D13  | Overcast| Hot        | Normal   | False  | Yes  |
| D14  | Sunny   | Mild       | High     | True   | No   |


step 1: Compute Entropy of the Whole Dataset  by using equation  1 
                    p+=4/6
                    p-=2/6
 so ,E(S)=0.91

 step 2: compute entropy for weather attribute.

| Weather  | Yes (Play) | No (Play) | Total |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Sunny    | 0         | 2        | 2     |
| Overcast | 2         | 0        | 2     |
| Rainy    | 2         | 0        | 2     |

      
by applying equation 1 you will get entropy of sunny, overcast,rainy as 0,0,0
  after these apply equation 3 
    so, E(After) is also 0

step 3:  Compute Information Gain for Weather
        apply equation 2 
        so IG(weather)=0.91
        
Since IG(Weather) is high, it is a good splitting attribute.

Step 4: Compute Information Gain for Wind

| Windy | Yes (Play) | No (Play) | Total |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Yes   | 2         | 2        | 4     |
| No    | 2         | 0        | 2     |

Entropy for windy =Yes:
    E(yes)=1
Entropy for windy =No:
   E(no)=0
 information gain is   0.24

 step 5: Choose the best attribute
 IG(weather)=0.91
 IG(windy)=0.24 
 Since Weather has the highest IG (0.91), it is chosen as the root node for the decision tree.
      Weather
     /   |   \
 Sunny  Overcast  Rainy
  |       |       |
  No     Yes      Yes
